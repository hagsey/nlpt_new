        <h3>What is it?</h3>

        <p>The 70 Day Challenge is a 10-week fitness, nutrition, and health program where you receive daily challenges, tasks, habits, and workouts from the coaches of NLPT. Score points by completing as many daily tasks as possible, report back in with the coaches, compete with others in the program, and have one of the most challenging yet rewarding periods of training that you've had in years.</p>

        <h3>What benefits can you expect from this program?</h3>

        <p>What you take from this program depends on who you are, what your experience level is, and what your goals are.</p>

        <p>Maybe you've struggled with consistency in the past and need a kick in the butt to get back on the right path.</p>

        <p>Maybe you're tired of your same old routine and just want to shake things up with something different.</p>

        <p>Maybe you've got a certain fitness or weight loss goal you hope to achieve during this time.</p>

        <p>Or maybe you're aware of the looming summer season, and want to stay ahead of the parties, patios, and beverages that are coming your way.</p>

        <h3>Who is it for?</h3>

        <p>You don't have to be advanced or experienced to participate! This program is for anyone 18 and older and who is relatively healthy enough to complete an intense fitness program. If you're unsure if this is a good fit for you, please <a href="mailto:info@mynlpt.com">contact</a> us, and we'd be happy to discuss it with you.</p>

        <p>Nope.</p>

        <ul>
          <li>We've made the nutrition program SIGNIFICANTLY more difficult</li>
          <li>We've created all new weekly team challenges</li>
          <li>We've tossed out MANY of the daily challenges that got used last time and replaced them with more interesting and creative tasks</li>
          <li>Winning team members will get prizes :)</li>
        </ul>
