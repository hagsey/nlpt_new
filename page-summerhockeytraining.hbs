<p>Since 2008, we've been training some of the region's top hockey players as they prepare for their upcoming seasons.</p>

<p>There have been dozens of professional, NCAA/CIS (both male and female), and OHL level players through our doors, not to mention hundreds of Junior and minor hockey players who have all taken on the challenge of a serious, properly structured strength and conditioning program. </p>

<p>The hallmarks of our program have been and continue to be: 

  <ol>
    <li>A holistic, comprehensive training program that includes off-ice training, on-ice instruction, and lifestyle strategies for optimized performance.</li>
    <li>Delivering expert coaching and instruction</li>
    <li>Creating a competitive, motivating atmosphere</li>
    <li>Providing an individualized experience</li>
  </ol>

    <h2 class="section-heading">Strength and Conditioning</h2>

    <h4>Assessments</h4>
    <img class="alignright" src="/assets/images/content-image-1.jpg" />
    <p>At the start and end of each training block, all players will undergo a comprehensive battery of fitness tests designed to give both the coach, and the athlete a good sense of strengths, weaknesses, and how the training plan should address them.</p>
    <p>Athletes will be given a full fitness report so that they're aware of the items they need to focus on during the summer.</p>

    <h4>Training design</h4>
    <p>Our training program is designed to address the core athletic qualities that are essential to the game of hockey: A high level of physical strength, explosive speed and power, core stability, and a high level of conditioning and resistance to fatigue.</p>
    <p>We structure our program to develop these attributes simulaneously, but in a series of blocks that build upon each other in a way that allows the athlete to make steady progress, but in a balanced, sensible system that doesn't overstress the athlete to the point of burnout or injury.</p>
    <img class="alignright" src="/assets/images/hp2018-2.jpg" />
    <p>Above all, we heavily stress the importance of quality over quantity. We pride ourselves in educating players on the importance of a properly designed warm-up, flawless lifting technique, and recovery strategies that promote growth and help keep the athlete healthy and injury-free.</p>

    <h4>Coaching</h4>
    <p>NLPT boasts the most experienced and educated coaching staff in the region. All of our coaches have pursued either kinesiology, human kinetics, or fitness and health degrees at the post-secondary level and beyond. They are fully certified and have lengthy athletic credentials to their name.</p>
    <p>But beyond their expertise, our coaching staff invests an incredible amount of care and attention into athlete at the gym. The #NLPTfamily is more than just a hashtag, itâ€™s a core principle of our gym.</p>
    <p>To learn more about NLPT's coaching staff and their qualifications, head over to our <a href="/staff">staff page</a>.</p>
    <h4>Environment</h4>
    <p>A good strength and conditioning program is about more than just exercises. Athletes need to be immersed in a culture that supports and pushes them to go beyond what they would otherwise do by themselves.</p>
    <p>It's the opportunity to train alongside other like minded individuals that heightens an athlete's competitive spirit and raises the bar of their self-perceived limitations. </p>
    <p>At NLPT, we take great efforts to not only offer a great program, but a great environment. Expectations are high, attention to detail is demanded, and competition is always encouraged.</p>
