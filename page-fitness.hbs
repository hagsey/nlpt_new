  <p>NLPT is Cambridge and Stratford’s hardest working gym. </p>
   
  <p>While big box gyms clutter their floor with machines and treadmills as their members work out to soft-rock playing over the stereo, we take the opposite approach. In order to prepare athletes for the demands of their sports, we need open space to move, run, and lift. And our lineup of equipment is comprised of the tried and true basics: barbells, dumbbells, kettlebells, suspension trainers, sleds, chains and ropes. What more do you need?</p>

  <p>But you don't have to be an athlete, or have years of experience in the weight room to train with us. We have the best, most educated coaching <a href="/staff">staff</a> in the region and they specialize in delivering a training product that meets the need of each individual--no matter what their circumstance may be.</p>

  <p>Our coaches have assisted with post-surgery rehab programs, created life-transforming weight-loss plans, prepared people for half-marathons, and coached countless others back to strength and health.</p>

  <p>Whether you're new to training and are looking for a basic training plan, or have years of experience and are comfortable doing your own thing, we have something for you.</p>

  <p>The only requirements are a desire to train, a great attitude, and a willingness to put in the work to get better--no matter what your goals are.</p>
   
  <p>But beyond the equipment and our programs, NLPT is about culture and family. We’re a small gym that prides itself on providing top quality coaching and program design in an engaging, hard-working, and welcoming environment. We’re chalk-friendly, loud-music friendly, and even dog-friendly. We’ve got a small clientele of good people that love to train hard, and train right.</p>

  <h3><b>Not sure if you're a good fit?</b></h3>

  <p>We've got four membership options to NLPT, each one designed for a unique purpose: Open Membership, NLPTfit, LEAN, and Advanced Program Design. Scroll down to read a little about each program.</p>

      <p>Have you ever walked into a gym, stared at all of the equipment, and just felt overwhelmed with all the options?</p>

      <p>This is a common situation, and it holds many people back from getting in shape. They simply don't know what to do or where to start. And even if they do have an idea, there's no confidence in that plan.</p>

      <p>For many, they end up sticking with the safest, most familiar exercises in order to avoid injury or embarrassment. But somewhere in the back of their mind they know that there's a better way.</p>

      <p>And unless they're willing to pay $65-$90 per session for a personal trainer, they're left with the internet and fitness magazines for insight and guidance.</p>

      <p>This is where we offer something different.</p>

      <p>If you’re new to training or simply want more structure and confidence in your routine, our NLPTfit monthly programming option may be for you.</p>

      <p>Each month, we create a balanced, comprehensive training program that emphasizes strength development, mobility training, and high-intensity conditioning. It’s a great fit for someone that wants to maintain their fitness and health, get stronger, or lose weight in a safe, time-effective manner.</p>

      <p>Each member receives a personalized training program with individual modifications made for any injuries or movement limitations.</p>

      <p>Coaches are on the floor during designated NLPTfit hours to instruct members on proper exercise technique and ensure each prescribed program is well suited to the member’s ability and skill. Additionally, coaches are there to push, motivate, and give members the confidence to take on challenges they never thought possible.</p>

      <p>NLPTfit also comes with ultimate flexibility. Members are still free to train as much as they like during open training hours, however coaching may not always be available. We suggest attending NLPTfit hours at least during your first week so you can get a grasp on all of the components of the program.</p>
